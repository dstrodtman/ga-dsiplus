# Finding Your Voice & Defining Your Brand

## Learning Objectives:

* Understand the value of a personal brand

* Understand how to create your personal brand

* Improve your elevator pitches by learning how to utilize storytelling techniques

* Have the necessary feedback and data to create your personal brand

## Framing:

Your brand is your value proposition. It is important to understand who you are as a professional in your chosen field. It is what makes you uniquely qualified over candidates who are just merely qualified based solely on hard skills.

But how do you promote your brand and talents? Don’t worry, we’ve got you covered!  We will show you how to explain yourself and your talents in a compelling and interesting way so that your brand doesn’t get lost in translation.

This will help you to establish your pitch when you are at the student spotlight, interviewing and networking! 

## Format: 

Guest presenter Mike Gardner will take you through an interactive workshop to answer these questions.

## Homework: 

Check your class calendar for HW due next Tuesday at 7 pm
